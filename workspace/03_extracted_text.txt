Image Segmentation
Image Segmentation is finding the group of pixels that are similar: It is partitioning the image into various subgroups (of pixels) called image objects: Assigning labels to pixels, and the pixels with the same labels fall under single category Using these labels, user can specify boundaries, draw lines and separate the most required objects in an image from unnecessary pixel label.
